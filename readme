# 🛡️ Log Analysis using Python

## 📌 Description
This project focuses on analyzing system log files (such as `auth.log`) to identify failed login attempts and suspicious activity. It simulates a basic SOC task of log filtering, data extraction, and reporting.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- Python (with Regex and File I/O)
- Linux Log Files (`/var/log/auth.log`)
- Basic Log Forensics
- Cybersecurity Analysis

## 🔍 What It Does
- Parses log file line‑by‑line
- Extracts IP addresses, timestamps, and login failures
- Generates a simple report of failed login sources

## 📁 Files
- `log_parser.py`: The script for parsing logs
- `sample-auth.log`: Sample log file (optional/test data)

## ✅ Learning Outcome
- Understanding log structure in Linux
- Using Python to automate SOC tasks
- Practicing threat detection and analysis basics
